\description{
Tools to Aid in Debugging Issues Across R Sessions

Package-level function that enales direct calling & naming of an output file.
}
\details{
You can either:

source(system.file("scripts", "triage.R", package="triage"))

for automatic usage or use this function like so:

triage::triage()

and have the flexibility of supplying parameters.

The following bits are colected and --- where possible --- tidied:
\itemize{
\item environment variables
\item options settings
\item R version & platform information
\item Base packages
\item Other packages
\item Loaded pacakges
\item Object names, sizes and classes in the global environement, including hidden ones
}

NOTE: This is a \emph{dangerous} function since the output may contain \strong{sensitive data},
including, but not limited to, API keys or other credentials. Do not share carelessly.
